# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Linear_Regression%20Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Identifying Customers Likely to Subscribe for Term Deposit](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/logistic_regression_project_JoseA.ipynb)

<img src="images/banking-in-portugal-1920x1080.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to identify potential bankers based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/KNN_and_NaiveBayes_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to find human abnormalities on various atributes
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Identifying total compensation depending on all benefits](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Kmeans_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/K-means.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to total compensation of employees on various atributes
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Identifying most important atributes to better predict housing market](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/PCA_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/pca%20housing.png?raw=true"/>

- Used principle component analysis to reduce non important atributes to better estimate house market value
- Scale data for best PCA consants without loss of information
- Found number of components with at least a 90% variance

***

[Identifying possible click fraud by legitimizing user atributes](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Talk_Data_Boosting_Bagging.ipynb)

<img src="images/fraud-data.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the Random Forest, Bagging classifier, and XGBoost classifier 
- Used these three models to distinguige click fraud base on accuracy
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Deep learning model to identify images between a dog or a cat](https://github.com/Jamaya1st/Jamaya1st.github.io/blob/master/Projects/CNN_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/cat_dogs.jfif?raw=true"/>

- Used convolution neuro network model to train a series of pictures of dogs and cats
- there are two convolution layers with relu activatioon with two pooling layers of 2x2 kernels with 2 step stride
- following the flattening stage, the full conection stage uses relu activation with a sigmoid output to hold within 0 to 1 boundaries
- Selected best parameters based on train and test performance using 30 epochs
- the model identifies dogs and cats with 92% accuracy
